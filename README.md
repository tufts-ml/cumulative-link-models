## Setup

### Install Anaconda
Follow the instructions here: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html

### Create environment
```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Demo

### Diabetes Disease Progression Prediction

This demo creates a simple network model in TensorFlow to predict the progression
of the diabetes.

The [Diabetes dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#diabetes-dataset) from sklearn is used.

The raw target attribute is a reak valuequantitative measure of the disease 
progression one year after baseline. A `KBinsDiscretizer` is used to bin the
continuous target data and encode ordinal labels such that each bin contains
the same number of data points.

To run the notebook demo:

1. Navigate to the notebook located at
```sh
cumulative-link-models/demo/ordinal_regression_via_CLMs.ipynb
```
2. Set the kernel as the conda environment (refer above for instructions)
3. Run the notebook to create, train, and assess the model
